    "Title": "Identifying HDAC3 inhibitors",
    "Description": "The model predicts the inhibitory potential of small molecules against Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), a relevant human target for cancer, inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes. The authors have used a dataset of 1098 compounds from ChEMBL and validated the model using the benchmark MUBD-HDAC3.",
